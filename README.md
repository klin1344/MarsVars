Top 7 Finalist at MLH Prime Southwest 2016.

MarsVars is a Martian VR Simulator targeted for astronauts-in-training. The interface walks the user through tasks to mimic possible scenarios in the barren Martian terrain. To make the experience realistic, our platform includes a "Mission Control" feature, so someone on the outside can vary parameters to change the world the astronaut sees. From unexpected storms to cold nights, our users should be ready for anything!
